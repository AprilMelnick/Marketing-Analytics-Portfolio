                        <h2>Overview</h2>
                        <p>Feeling confident with Basic SQL, I wanted to upskill and learn window functions. I completed this case study using a project created by Data Analyst, Danny Ma.</p>

                        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
                        <p>Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.</p><p>He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program - additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.</p>

                        <h2>Data Exploration</h2>
                        <p style="padding-bottom: 0;">Danny has shared with you 3 key datasets for this case study:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li class="about">sales</li>
                            <li class="about">menu</li>
                            <li class="about">members</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p style="padding-bottom: 0;">The following questions were proposed for data exploration:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li class="numbered">What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?</li>
                            <li class="numbered">How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?</li>
                            <li class="numbered">What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?</li>
                            <li class="numbered">What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?</li>
                            <li class="numbered">Which item was the most popular for each customer?</li>
                            <li class="numbered">Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?</li>
                            <li class="numbered">Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?</li>
                            <li class="numbered">What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?</li>
                            <li class="numbered">If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?</li>
                            <li class="numbered">In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h2>Key Learning</h2>
                        <p>From time to time, I would get stuck and reference YouTube video solutions. With question 10, I wasn't happy with the suggested solutions I was finding.</p>
                        <p>Since the data set was small, I got out a pen and paper to figure out the totals I should be getting. The proposed solution was off.</p>

                        <p>After some experimenting, I found that the Interval function was not operating correctly in a RANK() function, so the proper dates weren't being filtered.</p>
                        <p>I found the solution to create a date window for the filtering and was finally able to match my pen and paper solution.</p>
                        <p>I learned that it's key to trust your instincts and double check your work manually, if you must.</p>
