            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <div class="about-section">
                <p>At heart, I'm a problem solver and systems thinker. Considering the entire ecosystem of a project and asking the right questions is my strength.</p>
                <p>Delivering information in a people-friendly way is a skill I've honed through years of explaining complicated coffee processes and probably the skill I'm most proud of.</p>
                <p style="color:  rgba(173, 194, 255, 1);">Wait... coffee? Yes, I'm in a career transition. Let me tell you a bit about my journey.</p>
                <p>After a long career in specialty coffee, it was time for a change. UX seemed like a good use of my transferrable skills and I was surprised to find it all kind of conceptually... easy?</p>

                <h6>Showing off my cappuccino skills</h6>
                <p>UX felt familiar because I had spent over a decade building and maintaining structures that keep customers caffeinated, employees happy and bosses making money.</p>
                <p style="color:  rgba(173, 194, 255, 1);">BUT, I rarely felt the flow state while studying UX.</p>
                <p>UI was next. Design felt natural to me, as I've run my own small experimental fashion label: conceptualizing, drafting patterns and producing the clothes. UI seemed a good fit.

                <p style="color:  rgba(173, 194, 255, 1);">With UI, there was flow, but no passion.</p>
                <p>While designing, there was one thing I couldn't keep from creeping in to my mind: what about the developers? How would they feel about my designs?  I started learning Webflow. No-code development brought me one step closer to cracking the developer puzzle.</p>

                <h6><a href="https://handling-noise.webflow.io/" target="_blank">A blog about my field recording</a>  I designed and built using Webflow CMS</h6>
                <p style="color:  rgba(173, 194, 255, 1);">More understanding, more flow...</p>
                <p>Next, a round of sessions with a career coach turned me on to Marketing Analytics.</p>
                <p>Together we realized that I had:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="about">Practical, real world marketing experience</li>
                    <li class="about">Excellent problem solving skills</li>
                    <li class="about">Ability to quickly learn new programs</li>
                    <li class="about">Effective communication</li>
                    <li class="about">Lots of self-motivation</li>
                </ul>
                <p>When I found the WBS Coding School Marketing Analytics course, I signed up!</p>
                <p>Diving right in to the course, HTML and CSS were easy to grasp, thanks to my Figma and Webflow skills.</p>
                <p style="color:  rgba(173, 194, 255, 1);">Flowing...</p>
                <p>Querying databases, Google Tag Manager, JavaScript, everything the course threw at me, I rolled right through. Troubleshooting and debugging happily along the way.</p>

                <p style="color:  rgba(173, 194, 255, 1);">DEFINITELY flowing, the beginnings of passion...</p>
                <p>Not only did I learn technical skills during this process, I also proved to myself that I have the ability to provide meaningful quantitative and qualitative business insight.</p>
                <p>Now that I'm prepared with an analytic tool belt and the understanding to clearly report my findings, I'm ready to find solutions for you.</p>
